<h2>A wrong comment can cost anything!</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Some programmers (who didn't read this topic, obviously) wrote code with too many comments. They forgot to add the required symbol for comments and also added unnecessary comments to some lines. As a result, the code does not compile.</p>
<p>You need to comment on some lines and remove some comments within the <code class="java">main()</code> function to make the program compile.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
